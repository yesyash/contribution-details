### Get a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):
1. Go to your GitHub Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic).
2. Click "Generate new token" (or "Generate new token (classic)").
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "PR Script").
4. Set an expiration date.
5. Under "Select scopes", check the repo scope (or at least public_repo if you only need public repositories within the org).
6. Click "Generate token".
7. Copy the token immediately! You won't be able to see it again. Treat it like a password.
